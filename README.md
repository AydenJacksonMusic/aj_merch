# code_challenge
Code challenge for a potential Upwork client.

- Since this project had to be done with Plain HTML I decided to split the content into Revealing Module pattern.
- Using a regex that i already created for the brand that i work for emails, but i was thinking to add the mailcheck library too.
- I think the code itself says what it does that's why i Didn't add any comment, but if this is desired i can do it :).
- Decided to use another convention for the naming of the JS classes, if wanted to use the CSS classNames that would be ok for me too.
- Decided to set some global variables for the elements to avoid searching then, i went for this solutions since it was the easier to follow from my opinion.
- Decided to disable the button on the load to save some time/code.
- I could added code for deleting the value of the input after the submit, same for deleting the success message but i didn't want to went out of the scope to much.

Thanks!
